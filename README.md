# Panther with Bootstrap Datatables
This sample contains a responsive Panther Grid/Bootstrap Datatable screen. The sample also demonstrates a JQuery Click event on a row.
Below is the screenshot of the completed Login screen in the Brower. Most of the HTML and js was generated by the Panther Migration Utility. Bootstrap libraries were used to transform the plan screen into a modern, responsive screen. JPL validation and SQL functionality remain the same. Some of the JPL was rewritten in Javascript.
